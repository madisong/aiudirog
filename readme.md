-Google Voice Client (Designed on and for Linux)

This is a program I decided to write when I found that there was a serious lack of a desktop application outside of a browser for Google Voice. Thanks to the creaters of pyGoogleVoice, I had an API to work with. Since this API has to rely on HTML and JSON downloads, it tends to be a bit slow, but not incredibly. I have found if I keep my inbox clean (reducing the downloaded data), it will get the message withen 5 seconds or less of my phone.
